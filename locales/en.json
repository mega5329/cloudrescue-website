      "paragraph1": "Cloud Rescue Foundation was born from a simple observation: countless people want to help rescue dogs but face barriers like distance, long-term commitment requirements, and lack of transparency. Meanwhile, rescue shelters in China struggle with chronic funding shortages and lack of international connections.",

By creating a platform that enables \"cloud sponsorship,\" we allow people worldwide to make meaningful weekly contributions to dogs they care about, while maintaining complete transparency through video updates and direct communication with shelter managers.",

      "paragraph4": "The founder personally cares for four dogs—three rescued from the streets or shelters—and has volunteered for years at a homeless shelter. After witnessing the shelter's funding gaps, they donated personal funds and then invested their own time and money to build Cloud Rescue Foundation."
