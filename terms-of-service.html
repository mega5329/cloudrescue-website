          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">5.1 How Cloud Adoption Works</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Cloud Adoption allows you to remotely sponsor rescue dogs through recurring donations:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Random Dog:</strong> $9.90/week (matched with a dog in need)</li>
            <li><strong>Specific Dog:</strong> $59.99 for 5 weeks (choose your dog)</li>
            <li><strong>Size-Based:</strong> Small dogs $9.99/week, Medium $15.99/week, Large $20.99/week</li>
            <li><strong>Renewal:</strong> Flexible 1-20 weeks at your dog's size rate</li>
            <li>Donations support food, medical care, and shelter operations</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3 mt-6">5.2 Donations and Payments</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            All donations are voluntary and non-refundable unless required by law. By making a donation:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
            <li>You authorize recurring charges (for weekly subscriptions)</li>
            <li>You understand donations go directly to shelter operations</li>
            <li>You acknowledge Cloud Rescue Foundation retains a small administrative fee to maintain platform operations</li>
            <li>You agree to provide valid payment information</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3 mt-6">5.3 Video Updates</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Shelters are required to provide weekly video updates of sponsored dogs. If a shelter fails to provide updates 
            for two consecutive weeks, the dog becomes ineligible for cloud adoption until updates resume. We will notify 
            you and offer to reassign your sponsorship.
